## Issue With FileZilla Pro “Perpetual License” and Access to Installers

This document describes a problem encountered with a FileZilla Pro “perpetual license.”

* I originally purchased FileZilla Pro under a perpetual, one-time license.
* After reinstalling my operating system, I attempted to reinstall the version I legally own.
* FileZilla support confirmed that I am *allowed* to use any version released before I accepted their updated Terms and Conditions.
* However, when asked for the installer for that version, support refused to provide it, stating that they “do not provide older versions for security reasons.”
* Without access to the installer, the perpetual license becomes effectively unusable.
* Support suggested purchasing a new subscription instead.

In practice, this means that although the perpetual license is acknowledged, FileZilla does not provide any way for customers to reinstall the version they paid for, making the license functionally impossible to use after an OS reinstall.
