## FileZilla Pro “Perpetual License” - A Warning to All Users

This is a blunt warning to anyone who ever purchased, or is thinking about purchasing, FileZilla Pro.

I bought FileZilla Pro under a **perpetual license** - a one-time payment, lifetime right to use the version I purchased. After reinstalling my operating system, I simply needed to reinstall the software I already paid for.

### Here’s what happened:

* Support admitted I **still have the legal right** to use the old version of FileZilla Pro that I originally purchased.
* Then they told me they **refuse to provide the installer** for that version.
* Their excuse: *“For security reasons we do not provide older versions.”*

### The impact:

If a customer cannot download the installer, the “perpetual license” is **dead**.
It doesn’t matter what rights they acknowledge on paper - they are blocking any practical way to use the software unless you pay again under their new subscription model.

There is no way to reinstall.
There is no way to access the product you bought.
Your “perpetual license” effectively becomes worthless the moment you reinstall your OS or lose the installer.

### What this means for users:

FileZilla is fully aware that customers legally own those old versions.
They openly admit it.
And then they withhold the installer anyway, leaving users with no realistic option except paying again.

If you’re considering FileZilla Pro, understand exactly what you are walking into:
You can pay for a perpetual license, and later be denied any way to reinstall the product you legally own.

### Name clarification

Although “Zilla” appears in the name, the FileZilla project is not affiliated with Mozilla in any way. I mention this because, at the time I purchased FileZilla Pro, I personally assumed the project was connected to Mozilla. That assumption made me trust the product more than I should have, and I learned the truth the hard way.

### My Perspective

Based on my experience, I believe FileZilla’s refusal to provide the installer is driven by financial motives rather than security. In the very first email I received from support, before offering any real help, they immediately suggested that I buy the newest version and even offered me a discount. That interaction, combined with the fact that they were still providing updates to the copy already installed on my computer, makes the security explanation hard to accept and reinforces my belief that the real motive is financial.
